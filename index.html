                <p>With a degree in computer science from Universidade Pedagógica and ITIL certification, I have basic
 
                    knowledge of networking and programming.<br> In addition, I have 5 years of experience working as a
                    Helpdesk.<br> I am seeking opportunities that allow me to apply and expand my knowledge of technology,
                    helping to solve problems and provide quality support to users and clients.<br> I am a dedicated, proactive
                    and committed person, always striving to provide effective and efficient solutions.<br>
                    Having successfully completed the ITILv4 exam, I acquired an extreme passion for doing training and self-study
                    such as HPE(HP), Lenovo, windows server, CompTIA N+, finishing some of them with certificate of completion. <br>
                    I turned my personal learning into a lifestyle.</p>
